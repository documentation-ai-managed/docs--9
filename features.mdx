| Tags | Add labels like `guide`, `api` | Filter sidebar by `["feature", "guide"]` |
| Folders | Nest pages hierarchically | `/guides/features.mdx` |
| Quick Nav | Breadcrumbs and sidebar links | Jump between `/introduction` and `/features` |

<Callout kind="info">
  Assign tags during page creation to enable advanced filtering. Use `{["guide", "core"]}` format in frontmatter if supported.
